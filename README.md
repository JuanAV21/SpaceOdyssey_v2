# SpaceOdyssey

##Team 8

This was a project done in Delaware State University Annual Hackathon. 

The idea behind developing this application is to have an educational App for middle scholars. It would include different planets as levels. In each level, it consists of two parts. Firstly, the students would be introduced to a quiz based on the planet. After, they would get to a minigame where they have to fly through astroids to get to the next planet.
